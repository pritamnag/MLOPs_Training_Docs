	Using AGILE Methodologies :
	
		We can able to achieve:
		
			- Continuous Development
			- Continuous Integration 
			- Continuous Testing 		
			- Continuous Delivery ::
				- It is a process used to release the changes to production environment, and it expects the manual approvals for production releases.
				
			
		We cannot achieve:		
			- Continuous Deployments ::
				- It is a process used to release the changes to production environment, and it never expects any manual approvals/intervension for production releases.

				- Continuous Deployments can be achieved based on the Application Architecture.
					- Application Architecture should be Micro-Service Based Application Architecture.

				
	
	DevOps :
	
		DevOps is Software Development Strategy, which helps to promote the collaboration between the teams like Development Team and Operations Team to achieve Continuous Development, Continuous Integration, Continuous Testing, Continuous Delivery, Continuous Deployments and Continuous Monitoring in more automated fashion.
		
		Shift Left Approach! - DevSecOps
		
		Dev -> Test -> Production
		
		
		Development Teams' Workload :
		
			- New Project 
			
			- Enhancement Projects / Bug Fixing 
			
		Parallel development :::
		
			- Achieved using Git Branching stragies 
			
			
		How to Implement DevOps ???						<======>   				MLOps
		
		
		- Identify the Teams :

			Devops Team :
				- Infra-Structure Management Team 
						20+ Test Servers - Provision & Configure
							-> IAC Tools - Terraform/Ansible						
				- App Development Team 
				- Testing Teams 
				- Release Management Team 
				- Production Support Team 
				- Production Monitoring Team 
				- IT Security Team 
				
				
		- Application Architecture :
			
			- Monolith Application Architecture :::
				- Monolith Applications are Tightly Coupled Applications
				- All the Functions/dependencies are created, tested, and deployed as whole Application
				- We can achieve Continuous Delivery. Not Continuous Deployment
				
			
			- Micro-Service Based Architecture :::
			
				- It is a loosely coupled Application Architecture
				- Whole Application is divided into Micro-Services 
				- Continuous Deployment can be achieved only using Micro-Service Based Application Architecture
				
		Continuous Delivery :

			- Continuous Delivery ::
				- It is a process used to release the changes to production environment, and it expects the manual approvals for production releases.

					Core Banking Applications / Insurance Applications ::::
					
						-> On-Prem Infra-Structure
						
						-> Cloud Infra-Structure
						
						-> Downtime?				
			

			- Continuous Deployments ::
				- It is a process used to release the changes to production environment, and it never expects any manual approvals/intervension for production releases.

				- Continuous Deployments can be achieved based on the Application Architecture.
					- Application Architecture should be Micro-Service Based Application Architecture.

			- ML Model creation at enterprise level :
				- Dependencies
				- Multiple Teams Involved in the process 
				- Risk associated with each team and dependent systems 
				- Infra-Structure - Auto Scaling and Load Balancing 
				
	How to Implement MLOps :
	
	- Data Engineers		-> Prepare the Source Data sets 
	
	- Data Scientists 		->  Explore the datasets, analyse, check the feasibility of datasets 
								Perform the training, tuning, and evaluate the Model
	
	- ML Engineers 			-> Deploy the ML Models to prod -> MLOps Strageies CICD, define best practises
								Should have MLOps Knowledge
	
	- Business Stakeholders --> Bring business values using this ML Models 
	
	- Data Security/Governance Team  --> To Ensure data security & Governance, data privacy
	
	
	DevOps can be used to automate the typical Software Application Build and Deployments using CICD Pipelines

		<html>
		---
		---
		-
		---
		-
		---
		</html>
		
		save as index.html 
	
	
		<html>
		---asdf
		---asdf
		-
		---
		-
		---
		</html>	
	
		save as index.html 	
		
	Version Control System like Git :
	
	
		Create index.html 
		
		<html>
		---
		---
		-
		---
		-
		---
		</html>	
	
	
		save as index.html		==> index.html_v1.0		(Tag/Version_Number/Commit_ID)
	
		<html>
		---
		---
		-

	Working with Distributed Version Control System :	
	
		- Git File Workflow 
		- Git Branching Techniques
		- Git Cli Commands 
		- Git Remote Repositories - GitHub
		- Github Action
		
	
	Git Client	--> Is Command Line Utility installed in Local Machine 
	
	GitHub 		--> Remote Git Repository Server 
		
	
	- Git File Workflow 	
		- What is Distributed VCS ? - Core Architecture of GIT 
	
	- Developers' Workload :
	
		-> New Project 		
		-> Enhancement / Bug fixing Project
		
	- Git File Workflow ::::
	
	Local Machine :																				Remote Server(GitHub) :
	
	Install Git client 
	
	Working Directory 				Staging Area 				Local Repository					Remote Repository
	
	index.html		  -------------> index.html  --------------> index.html_v1.1 ------------------> index.html_v1.1
						 git add 					git commit						  git push
	index.html		  -------------> index.html  --------------> index.html_v1.2 ------------------> index.html_v1.2
						 git add 					git commit						  git push
	index.html		  -------------> index.html  --------------> index.html_v1.3 ------------------> index.html_v1.3
						 git add 					git commit						  git push
	index.html		  -------------> index.html  --------------> index.html_v1.4 ------------------> index.html_v1.4
						 git add 					git commit						  git push
	
	
	
	
	Git File Workflow Cli Commands :
	
	
	
	git clone		==>		To Copy/Clone the entire remote repository to local machine 	
	
	git add 		==> 	To add the change from Working Directory to Staging Area 
	
	git commit 		==> 	To Commit the changes from Staging Area to Local Repository
	
	git push		==> 	To push the changes from Local Repository to the Remote Repository
	
	git fetch/git pull ::
	
			-> Both git fetch and git pull commands are used to handle the incremental changes from Remote Repository


			git fetch :	
				- It is used to just check for incremental changes in Remote Repository, if any incremental changes exist, the git fetch command will update the details of the changes in the Local Repository not in the Working Directory.
		
		
			git pull :
				- It is used to check for incremental changes in Remote Repository, if any incremental changes exist, the git pull command will update the changes in the Local Repository as well as in the Working Directory.	
				
				As a best practice, it is always recommended to use git pull to keep the Local Repositories in-sync with Remote Repository
				
				git pull = git fetch + git merge 
				
				
	git init 		==> 	To Intialize/Create local git repository
							To Create default branch master/main 
							To Create .git/ directory

	- Undo the Committed Changes ::::	

		- git reset / revert 

		git reset :::
		
			git reset is used to undo the changes from the repository
			git reset will reset the commit point to the previous commit point 
			git reset will not create any new commit point for track purpose 
			git reset is not recommended in the shared repository 


		Syntax :		
			- git reset <reset_option> <previous_Commit_ID>
			
		Reset Options ::
		
			git reset --soft <previous_Commit_ID> :::
				- git reset will reset the HEAD pointer to the previous commit point.
				- It will take the changes back to staging area 
				- The Changes will be available in staging area and working directory					
		
			git reset --mixed <previous_Commit_ID> :::		# Default
				- git reset will reset the HEAD pointer to the previous commit point.
				- It will take the changes back to working directory 
				- The Changes will be available only in working directory			
			
			git reset --hard  <previous_Commit_ID> :::
				- git reset will reset the HEAD pointer to the previous commit point.
				- It will permanently delete the files from the system 
			

	ML Project & MLOps :
	
	
	
	ETL Process :
	
	
		Extract 		--> 	Monitor Tool 		--> 	Extract raw content		--> 	Committed to Git Repo.
		
		Transform 		--> 	Process the Data from that commit point 
		
		Load 			--> 	Processed Data will be saved to the Dataset 
		
		
	
	git revert :::
	
		- Git Revert is same as git reset --hard option 		
		- git revert is used to undo a specific commit 		
		- git revert will create a new commit point for tracking purpose.		
		- git revert will maintain the commit history		
		- git revert is recommended in shared repositories
		
		Syntax ::
			git revert <specific_Commit_ID>
			
			
	GIT Branches:
	
		- Branches are the logical copy of repository(default branch)
		- It used to perform parallel development 
		- Branches provides isolated path for the developer to independently code the changes 
		
		
	GIT Branching Strategies :::
	
		- Git Branching Strategies are used to maintain the integrity of the default branch - main/master
		
	Scenario 1:	
		
		Repo1:
		
			master : cm1,cm2,cm3
						cm1,cm2,cm3,f1_cm1,f1_cm2						# Upon Merging feature1_Branch.
				
			
				feature1_Branch : cm1,cm2,cm3 ---> Assign to a Developer 1.
								: cm1,cm2,cm3,f1_cm1,f1_cm2
								
								--> Upon testing and review, merge the incremental changes from feature1_Branch to master branch
	
		
	Scenario 2:	
		
		Repo1:
		
			master : cm1,cm2,cm3
						cm1,cm2,cm3,cm4 				# 'cm4' - is the Incremental Changes from Developer_Branch
			
				Developer_Branch : cm1,cm2,cm3
									cm1,cm2,cm3,f1_cm1,f1_cm2,f2_cm1,f2_cm2		# Upon Merging feature1&2.

	Working with Git Branches :


		- git branch 							# to get the list of branches 
		
		- git branch <new_branch_name>			# Create new_branch
		
		- git switch -c <new_branch_name>		# Create new_branch & Switch to new_branch.
		
		- git switch <exiting_branch_name>		# Switch to a branch
		
		
		- Repo 
		
			master : cm1 
			
				feature1 : cm1 
				
							cm1,f1cm1
							
							git switch master 							
							
							git merge feature1 				# Merge should executed from the target branch 
							
	GIT Merge Conflicts :

		- When more than one user/feature try to update same file at the same level, merge conflict occurs.
		
		
	Handle/Fix Merge Conflicts :

		- How to fix Merge Conflicts ?
		
			- Identify the file(s) causing the merge conflicts
			- Open the file and review the changes 
			- Upon review, decide which changes to be retained/delete from that file(s).
			- Update the file by removing the extra header/footer notes and contents.
			- Perform git add and git commit to fix the issue.
								
								
	On DevOps Perspective, We NEVER Fix the Merge Conflicts. We always PREVENT Merge Conflicts. 
	
	- Promote Collaboration!
	
	Git Provides Techniques to handle the conflicts :
	
	
	- GIT Rebase :

		- Rebase is used to maintain linear commit history 
		- Rebase is used to keep the current branch in-sync with target branch 
		- Rebase can prevent merge-conflicts in the target branch 
		- As a best practise, it is always recommended to use rebase before merge	
		
		
		Repo1: 
		
			master: cm1,cm2,cm3
			
						cm1,cm2,cm3,f1cm1,f1cm2,f1cm3						# Upon merging feature1
						
						
						cm1,cm2,cm3,f2cm1,f2cm2,f2cm3,f1cm1,f1cm2,f1cm3		# upon merging feature2 without proper rebase.
						
						
						cm1,cm2,cm3,f1cm1,f1cm2,f1cm3,f2cm1,f2cm2,f2cm3		# Expected Commit History can be achieved with proper rebase

	- GIT SQUASH :::
	
		- It is a merge Option. Is used to combine more than one commits into single commit point.
	
		Repo:
		
			master : cm1 
						cm1,f1cm1,f1cm2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,...............,f1cm140
			
				feature1 : cm1 
				
							cm1,f1cm1,f1cm2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,...............,f1cm140
							
							git switch master 
							
							git merge --squash feature1  
							
								git commit -m "Combined commits from feature1"

	GIT Cherrypick ::::
	
		- Is to merge the specific commit to the target branch.
		
		Eg.: 
		
		Repo1 :
		
			master : cm1 
			
				feature1 : cm1 
				
							cm1,f1cm1,f1cm2,f1cm3
	
		
						git switch master 
						
						git cherrypick <f1cm1>						
							
			Syntax: 
			
				git cherrypick <commit_id1> <commit_id2>
