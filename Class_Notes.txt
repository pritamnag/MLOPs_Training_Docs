	Using AGILE Methodologies :
	
		We can able to achieve:
		
			- Continuous Development
			- Continuous Integration 
			- Continuous Testing 		
			- Continuous Delivery ::
				- It is a process used to release the changes to production environment, and it expects the manual approvals for production releases.
				
			
		We cannot achieve:		
			- Continuous Deployments ::
				- It is a process used to release the changes to production environment, and it never expects any manual approvals/intervension for production releases.

				- Continuous Deployments can be achieved based on the Application Architecture.
					- Application Architecture should be Micro-Service Based Application Architecture.

				
	
	DevOps :
	
		DevOps is Software Development Strategy, which helps to promote the collaboration between the teams like Development Team and Operations Team to achieve Continuous Development, Continuous Integration, Continuous Testing, Continuous Delivery, Continuous Deployments and Continuous Monitoring in more automated fashion.
		
		Shift Left Approach! - DevSecOps
		
		Dev -> Test -> Production
		
		
		Development Teams' Workload :
		
			- New Project 
			
			- Enhancement Projects / Bug Fixing 
			
		Parallel development :::
		
			- Achieved using Git Branching stragies 
			
			
		How to Implement DevOps ???						<======>   				MLOps
		
		
		- Identify the Teams :

			Devops Team :
				- Infra-Structure Management Team 
						20+ Test Servers - Provision & Configure
							-> IAC Tools - Terraform/Ansible						
				- App Development Team 
				- Testing Teams 
				- Release Management Team 
				- Production Support Team 
				- Production Monitoring Team 
				- IT Security Team 
				
				
		- Application Architecture :
			
			- Monolith Application Architecture :::
				- Monolith Applications are Tightly Coupled Applications
				- All the Functions/dependencies are created, tested, and deployed as whole Application
				- We can achieve Continuous Delivery. Not Continuous Deployment
				
			
			- Micro-Service Based Architecture :::
			
				- It is a loosely coupled Application Architecture
				- Whole Application is divided into Micro-Services 
				- Continuous Deployment can be achieved only using Micro-Service Based Application Architecture
				
		Continuous Delivery :

			- Continuous Delivery ::
				- It is a process used to release the changes to production environment, and it expects the manual approvals for production releases.

					Core Banking Applications / Insurance Applications ::::
					
						-> On-Prem Infra-Structure
						
						-> Cloud Infra-Structure
						
						-> Downtime?				
			

			- Continuous Deployments ::
				- It is a process used to release the changes to production environment, and it never expects any manual approvals/intervension for production releases.

				- Continuous Deployments can be achieved based on the Application Architecture.
					- Application Architecture should be Micro-Service Based Application Architecture.

			- ML Model creation at enterprise level :
				- Dependencies
				- Multiple Teams Involved in the process 
				- Risk associated with each team and dependent systems 
				- Infra-Structure - Auto Scaling and Load Balancing 
				
	How to Implement MLOps :
	
	- Data Engineers		-> Prepare the Source Data sets 
	
	- Data Scientists 		->  Explore the datasets, analyse, check the feasibility of datasets 
								Perform the training, tuning, and evaluate the Model
	
	- ML Engineers 			-> Deploy the ML Models to prod -> MLOps Strageies CICD, define best practises
								Should have MLOps Knowledge
	
	- Business Stakeholders --> Bring business values using this ML Models 
	
	- Data Security/Governance Team  --> To Ensure data security & Governance, data privacy
	
	
	DevOps can be used to automate the typical Software Application Build and Deployments using CICD Pipelines

	What is Version Control System :

		- Version Control the Source Code Changes 
		- Is used to track the changes 
		
	
	Micro-Services 


	GIT :	
		- Is a Open-Source Distributed VCS
		- Version Control the Source Code Changes 
		- Is used to track the changes 
		- It is used to perform parallel development using Branching Techniques
		
	
	File System to save the source code. 
	
		Create index.html 
		
		<html>
		---
		---
		-
		---
		-
		---
		</html>
		
		save as index.html 
	
	
		<html>
		---asdf
		---asdf
		-
		---
		-
		---
		</html>	
	
		save as index.html 	
		
	Version Control System like Git :
	
	
		Create index.html 
		
		<html>
		---
		---
		-
		---
		-
		---
		</html>	
	
	
		save as index.html		==> index.html_v1.0		(Tag/Version_Number/Commit_ID)
	
		<html>
		---
		---
		-
		---
		-
		---
		</html>	
		
		save as index.html		==> index.html_v1.1
		save as index.html		==> index.html_v1.2	
		save as index.html		==> index.html_v1.3	
		save as index.html		==> index.html_v1.4	
		save as index.html		==> index.html_v1.5	
	
	
	Working with Distributed Version Control System :	
	
		- Git File Workflow 
		- Git Branching Techniques
		- Git Cli Commands 
		- Git Remote Repositories - GitHub
		- Github Action
		
	
	Git Client	--> Is Command Line Utility installed in Local Machine 
	
	GitHub 		--> Remote Git Repository Server 
		
	
	- Git File Workflow 	
		- What is Distributed VCS ? - Core Architecture of GIT 
	
	- Developers' Workload :
	
		-> New Project 		
		-> Enhancement / Bug fixing Project
		
	- Git File Workflow ::::
	
	Local Machine :																				Remote Server(GitHub) :
	
	Install Git client 
	
	Working Directory 				Staging Area 				Local Repository					Remote Repository
	
	index.html		  -------------> index.html  --------------> index.html_v1.1 ------------------> index.html_v1.1
						 git add 					git commit						  git push
	index.html		  -------------> index.html  --------------> index.html_v1.2 ------------------> index.html_v1.2
						 git add 					git commit						  git push
	index.html		  -------------> index.html  --------------> index.html_v1.3 ------------------> index.html_v1.3
						 git add 					git commit						  git push
	index.html		  -------------> index.html  --------------> index.html_v1.4 ------------------> index.html_v1.4
						 git add 					git commit						  git push
	
	
	
	
	Git File Workflow Cli Commands :
	
	
	
	git clone		==>		To Copy/Clone the entire remote repository to local machine 	
	
	git add 		==> 	To add the change from Working Directory to Staging Area 
	
	git commit 		==> 	To Commit the changes from Staging Area to Local Repository
	
	git push		==> 	To push the changes from Local Repository to the Remote Repository
	
	git fetch/git pull ::
	
			-> Both git fetch and git pull commands are used to handle the incremental changes from Remote Repository


			git fetch :	
				- It is used to just check for incremental changes in Remote Repository, if any incremental changes exist, the git fetch command will update the details of the changes in the Local Repository not in the Working Directory.
		
		
			git pull :
				- It is used to check for incremental changes in Remote Repository, if any incremental changes exist, the git pull command will update the changes in the Local Repository as well as in the Working Directory.	
				
				As a best practice, it is always recommended to use git pull to keep the Local Repositories in-sync with Remote Repository
				
				git pull = git fetch + git merge 
				
				
	git init 		==> 	To Intialize/Create local git repository
							To Create default branch master/main 
							To Create .git/ directory
